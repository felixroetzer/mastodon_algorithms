# mastodon_algorithms

This project is part of a research initiative at the Vienna University of Economics and Business, exploring alternative ranking mechanisms for decentralized social media, in specific Mastodon. It provides various algorithmic implementations for Mastodon, inspired by an analysis of centralized social media ranking systems such as the Twitter algorithm. The goal is to offer instance administrators flexible ranking methods beyond the default reverse chronological feed.
